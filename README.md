# Task Destroyer

## Project Description

Task Destroyer is a mobile application to help both high school and university students with poor task management to organize their academic tasks such as homework, exams, and quizzes. By providing intuitive task input along with due dates, prioritization, progress tracking and a straightforward calendar view about their tasks, Task Destroyer can help the students who are not comfortable to the new academic stage orderly manage their tasks and handle all of those with planning.

## Product Vision Statement

The vision of Task Destroyer focus on the group of high school or unversity students. These students have relative heavy academic workload, while many of them are not comfortable and don't know how to deal with the workload. Thus, our Task Destroyer aims to simplify the organization of academic tasks, helping students manage their workload without feeling overwhelmed. For an early release version, we will focus core features such as task lists, goal setting, and calendar overview. Our long-term goal is to help students stay organized, reduce stress, and ultimately improve their academic performance.
